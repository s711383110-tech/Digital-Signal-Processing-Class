## 🧠 Overview
This assignment demonstrates how to simulate an **RC Low-Pass Filter** using both continuous-time and discrete-time approaches.  
It includes mathematical derivations (Problems 1–6), C implementation, and waveform visualization in Python.

## 📘 Problem 1 – Continuous-Time Response
> **Goal:**  
> Derive the system output \( y(t) \) for input \( x(t) = e^{j\Omega t} \)  
> and express it in the form \( y(t) = H(\Omega)e^{j\Omega t} \).
